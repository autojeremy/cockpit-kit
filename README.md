# Cockpit Kit

Cockpit Kit is a global AI skill and script kit for operating a local-first knowledge repo from any supported AI environment.

It is an AI-agent local memory kit, not the Red Hat Cockpit Linux server administration console. The naming overlap is intentional for now, and this project is not affiliated with Red Hat Cockpit.

## What it does

- Installs one canonical `SKILL.md` into supported AI environments.
- Resolves a configured local knowledge repo from any working directory.
- Creates or links a starter Cockpit-compatible static HTML knowledge repo.
- Lints pages against the Cockpit Kit page contract.
- Generates a deterministic static search index.
- Serves the local repo over a loopback-only HTTP server with token auth by default.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- Git, when creating a new starter knowledge repo with the default initial commit.
- macOS or Linux for v1.

No package-manager install is required for v1. Runtime code uses Node.js built-in modules only.

## Install

Clone the kit wherever you want it to live. The documented convention is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autojeremy/cockpit-kit ~/.local/share/cockpit-kit
```

Create a new starter knowledge repo and install adapters:

```bash
node ~/.local/share/cockpit-kit/skill/scripts/setup.mjs \
  --cockpit-root ~/cockpit \
  --adapters agents,hermes,claude \
  --yes
```

Or link an existing Cockpit-compatible knowledge repo:

```bash
node ~/.local/share/cockpit-kit/skill/scripts/setup.mjs \
  --cockpit-root /path/to/knowledge-repo \
  --adapters agents,hermes,claude \
  --yes
```

Setup writes machine-local config to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/cockpit/config.toml`. The knowledge repo stays separate from the kit repo.

## Common commands

Resolve the configured knowledge repo:

```bash
node ~/.local/share/cockpit-kit/skill/scripts/where.mjs --json
```

Generate search index data:

```bash
node ~/.local/share/cockpit-kit/skill/scripts/search-index.mjs --root /path/to/knowledge-repo
```

Lint a knowledge repo strictly:

```bash
node ~/.local/share/cockpit-kit/skill/scripts/lint.mjs --root /path/to/knowledge-repo --strict
```

Serve a knowledge repo locally:

```bash
node ~/.local/share/cockpit-kit/skill/scripts/serve.mjs --root /path/to/knowledge-repo
```

`serve.mjs` binds to loopback by default and prints a tokenized URL. Use `--no-auth` only on a trusted machine.

## AI adapters

Setup can install symlinked adapters. Each adapter symlink points at the kit's `skill/` directory (the isolated AI-skill payload), not the repo root:

- Generic agents: `~/.agents/skills/cockpit -> /absolute/path/to/cockpit-kit/skill`
- Hermes: `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/skills/productivity/cockpit -> /absolute/path/to/cockpit-kit/skill`
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/cockpit -> /absolute/path/to/cockpit-kit/skill`

Symlinked adapters are live agent policy. Review diffs before pulling updates into an installed kit clone, and prefer tagged releases for stable installs.

## Development

Run the test suite with Node's built-in test runner:

```bash
node --test
```

Check whitespace before committing:

```bash
git diff --check
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs `node --test` on Ubuntu and macOS with Node 20 and 22.
